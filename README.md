# Human Action Recognition with Enhanced-SPMFs

## Introduction

This repository includes the codes and pre-trained models for the paper: "**_From skeleton sequences to enhanced motion maps: a new representation for 3D human action recognition with deep convolutional neural networks_"** by Huy Hieu Pham, Houssam Salmane, Louahdi Khoudour, Alain Crouzil, Pablo Zegers, and Sergio A. Velastin, which was submitted to [Pattern Recognition Letters](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition-letters), [Special issue on DLVA: Advances in Deep Learning and Visual Analytics for Intelligent Surveillance Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition-letters/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-dlva-advances-in-deep-learning-and-visual-a)



**Requirements**


In onder to train the deep neural networksin our experiments, you need to download and install [Keras](http://www.vlfeat.org/) with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the backend. Then navigate to the working folder and start to train DenseNets on GPU by the following commande:


 ```python file_name.py ```
 
 For example:
 
  ```python DenseNet-MSR-Action3D-AS1.py.py ```


**Experimental results**

(will be updated as soon as possible upon publication.)
