# Human Action Recognition with Enhanced-SPMFs

**Introduction**

This repository includes the codes and pre-trained models for our paper: "From skeleton sequences to enhanced motion maps: a new representation for 3D human action recognition with deep convolutional neural networks" by Huy-Hieu Pham, Louahdi Khoudour, Alain Crouzil, Pablo Zegers, and Sergio A. Velastin. We will publish our code and pre-trained models upon the paper is accepted.
