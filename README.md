# Human Action Recognition with Enhanced-SPMFs

## Introduction

This repository includes the codes and pre-trained models for the paper: "**_From skeleton sequences to enhanced motion maps: a new representation for 3D human action recognition with deep convolutional neural networks_"** by Huy Hieu Pham, Houssam Salmane, Louahdi Khoudour, Alain Crouzil, Pablo Zegers, and Sergio A. Velastin, which was submitted to [the 16th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition](https://www.aimiconf.org/iciar19/).



**Requirements**


To train the deep neural networks in our experiments, you need to download and install [Keras](http://www.vlfeat.org/) with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the backend and put image data to the folders. Then navigate to the working folder and start to train DenseNets on GPU by the following commande:


 ```python file_name.py ```
 
 For example:
 
  ```python DenseNet-MSR-Action3D-AS1.py```


**Experimental results**
